## ForestFey's Smilodon_wyred  
Adds surgery-options from "A Dog Said..." to Smilodon Populator.  
Has to be loaded after ADS and after FFSmilodonPopulator. With 0.18 ongoing, cross-compatibility problems should be solved, let me know if otherwise.  
  
CAUTION!!! 0.16 and 0.17 versions will still possibly overwrite any other ADS-patches when initalized. Other modded-in creatures will perhaps NOT have the additional surgery-options anymore. BE WARNED.  
However, if you want to be a not only responsible but also independent human being and solve that problem yourself, please go to the workshop page of "A Dog Said..." under http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=746425621, check out the GUIDE that is available there and follow it's instructions. If you don't already know what to do, that is.
